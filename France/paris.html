				<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->
				<p>Living in Paris for 5 months was the most incredible experience of my life. I studied at the famous Sorbonne, which is centerally located in the Latin Quarter of Paris.I	lived	with	a	French host mother in the 15th district, which was only about a 10 minute subway ride from the Sorbonne. </p>
				<p>In Paris I was lucky enough to explore the city, get familiar with locals, and eat deliciously. While I did visit many cities during my time abroad, I was always happy to come home to Paris. </p>
